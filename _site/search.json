No bold headers or flat icon style; all elements are rendered as semi-realistic scientific illustrations.\n\nPanel 1: \nExtraction and CharacterizationA stylized illustration of marine fish-derived raw material transitioning to a supercritical CO₂ extraction system, shown as a realistic laboratory apparatus rather than a cartoon machine.The extract is represented by a transparent amber vial.Adjacent is a GC–MS chromatogram with well-resolved peaks, labeled minimally.Below, accurate chemical structures of EPA and DHA are shown in line-bond format, clearly indicating unsaturated fatty acid chains.\n\n\nPanel 2:\nIn Vitro Antioxidant AssaysA 96-well microplate viewed from above replaces test tubes.Two assay conditions are shown:DPPH assay: wells transition from deep purple to pale yellowABTS assay: wells transition from blue-green to colorlessTo the side, free radicals are represented schematically using chemical structures (DPPH• and ABTS⁺•) with unpaired electrons, which are reduced upon interaction with antioxidant lipid molecules.No cartoon “spikes”; reduction is illustrated through electron transfer arrows and color change.\n\n\nPanel 3:\nIn Vivo Diabetic Mouse ModelA realistic laboratory mouse labeled “STZ-induced diabetic mouse” receives oral gavage via a feeding needle.Downstream arrows indicate sample collection:A 96-well ELISA plate with reduced absorbance intensityHistological sections of pancreatic tissue (H&E staining) shown as circular micrographs, comparing inflamed/disorganized islets versus structurally preserved islets after treatmentIcons are avoided; tissues appear as microscope-style images.\n\n\nPanel 4:\nMechanism and OutcomeA simplified but biologically accurate NF-κB signaling schematic shows inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation by lipid-derived bioactive compounds.Downstream effects are indicated subtly (reduced inflammatory signaling).Final outcomes include:A healthier pancreatic morphologyA blood glucose curve showing significant reduction over time compared with the diabetic controlOverall StyleMinimalist, neutral color palette, soft shadows, accurate proportions, and balanced spacing. No thick arrows, no bright headers, no flat icons. Designed to meet the visual and conceptual standards of Nature, Nature Food, or Nature Communications graphical abstracts."

Over the past few years, I’ve worked with researchers across different fields, helping them use AI tools in their academic work. Today, I want to share some practical tips on choosing the right AI tool for your research needs.\nI’ve noticed that many of my colleagues dismiss AI tools completely. Some see them as threats to academic integrity, while others simply don’t trust technology in scholarly work. I understand these concerns: they come from our commitment to quality and truth. However, I believe that if we use AI responsibly, there’s no problem with academic integrity. After all, academic misconduct existed long before AI.

    "section": "The Pre-Made Meal Analogy",
    "text": "The Pre-Made Meal Analogy\nLet me share a perspective from Chinese food culture that I find interesting. Traditional Chinese cooking emphasizes freshness and flavor above all else. The wok-based cooking method requires experienced chefs, high-temperature oil, and lightning-fast stir-frying techniques. This craft takes years to master—the perfect balance of heat, timing, and ingredient preparation creates dishes that capture the essence of “wok hei,” that irreplaceable smoky flavor.\nHowever, modern society has changed everything. People no longer have time to prepare lunch and dinner from scratch. Labor costs keep rising, making traditional cooking methods economically challenging. Even more significantly, busy shopping malls and city centers now ban open-flame cooking for safety reasons. These pressures have led to the birth of pre-made meals—industrially produced food that only needs simple heating before serving.\n\nMany people resist this change. They’d rather eat at questionable street stalls than accept pre-made meals, viewing them as inferior to “real” cooking. Yet just as modern society has made pre-made meals unavoidable, AI-generated content has become unavoidable in our work. The academic community is no exception. Rather than fighting this change, I encourage us to learn how to use it wisely, knowing what’s appropriate and what’s not."

    "section": "Three Key Uses of AI in Academic Research",
    "text": "Three Key Uses of AI in Academic Research\nThrough my work, I’ve found three areas where AI tools provide immediate, practical value:\n\n1. Data Analysis\nAI tools have changed how we approach data analysis. They’re not just code generators—they act as math consultants that can check principles, suggest analytical approaches, and find potential errors.\nAI tools are great at: - Generating and fixing statistical code in R, Python, or other languages - Explaining complex statistical ideas in simple terms - Checking math assumptions and finding potential problems - Suggesting good visualization methods\n\n\n2. Academic Writing: Helping Non-Native Speakers\nFor researchers whose first language isn’t English—and I work with many brilliant scholars—AI tools can be powerful writing assistants. They don’t write papers for you. Instead, they help make your ideas clearer and more professional.\nBeyond grammar fixes, these tools help with: - Improving sentence flow and connections between paragraphs - Suggesting better academic words - Finding unclear statements - Adjusting tone for different journals\n\n\n3. Resume and CV Development\nAcademic CVs need smart presentation of research achievements, publications, and teaching experience. I’ve helped many early-career researchers turn generic descriptions into strong stories of their scholarly impact.\nAI helps with: - Adding specific numbers to achievements - Tailoring CVs for different jobs - Finding gaps in your presentation - Suggesting strong action words"

This gives you access to the latest models with better reasoning capabilities and fewer usage limits. However, if you prefer not to pay subscription fees, both ChatGPT and Gemini offer free versions that are adequate for basic tasks. While these free versions have limitations—such as access to older models, slower response times, and usage caps—they can still handle routine academic tasks reasonably well. For occasional users or those just exploring AI tools, the free versions are a good starting point.\nIf you have decided to subscribe one AI tool, here are my tool picks:\nFor Data Analysis: I recommend Claude as the top choice for researchers who need careful statistical thinking and thorough consideration of methods. ChatGPT is an excellent second choice for its strong code generation.\nFor Academic Writing: Claude stands out for keeping your authentic scholarly voice while making writing clearer—critical for researchers building their academic identity. For non-native English speakers, ChatGPT is also excellent for handling diverse writing styles.\nFor CV Development: ChatGPT is the leader for creating multiple tailored versions for different applications. Claude works well as a backup for presenting achievements honestly.\nBudget Option: If cost matters most, DeepSeek offers great value for technical work."

Plagiarism, fake data, and questionable practices have been around for generations.\n\n\nLet me share a perspective from Chinese food culture that I find interesting. Traditional Chinese cooking emphasizes freshness and flavor above all else. The wok-based cooking method requires experienced chefs, high-temperature oil, and lightning-fast stir-frying techniques. This craft takes years to master—the perfect balance of heat, timing, and ingredient preparation creates dishes that capture the essence of “wok hei,” that irreplaceable smoky flavor.\nHowever, modern society has changed everything. People no longer have time to prepare lunch and dinner from scratch. Labor costs keep rising, making traditional cooking methods economically challenging. Even more significantly, busy shopping malls and city centers now ban open-flame cooking for safety reasons. These pressures have led to the birth of pre-made meals—industrially produced food that only needs simple heating before serving.\nMany people resist this change. They’d rather eat at questionable street stalls than accept pre-made meals, viewing them as inferior to “real” cooking. Yet just as modern society has made pre-made meals unavoidable, AI-generated content has become unavoidable in our work. The academic community is no exception. Rather than fighting this change, I encourage us to learn how to use it wisely, knowing what’s appropriate and what’s not.\n\n\n\nThrough my work, I’ve found three areas where AI tools provide immediate, practical value:\n\n\nAI tools have changed how we approach data analysis. They’re not just code generators—they act as math consultants that can check principles, suggest analytical approaches, and find potential errors.\nAI tools are great at: - Generating and fixing statistical code in R, Python, or other languages - Explaining complex statistical ideas in simple terms - Checking math assumptions and finding potential problems - Suggesting good visualization methods\n\n\n\nFor researchers whose first language isn’t English—and I work with many brilliant scholars—AI tools can be powerful writing assistants. They don’t write papers for you. Instead, they help make your ideas clearer and more professional.\nBeyond grammar fixes, these tools help with: - Improving sentence flow and connections between paragraphs - Suggesting better academic words - Finding unclear statements - Adjusting tone for different journals\n\n\n\nAcademic CVs need smart presentation of research achievements, publications, and teaching experience. I’ve helped many early-career researchers turn generic descriptions into strong stories of their scholarly impact.\nAI helps with: - Adding specific numbers to achievements - Tailoring CVs for different jobs - Finding gaps in your presentation - Suggesting strong action words\n\n\n\n\nBased on my testing and client feedback, here’s how the major AI tools compare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTool\nData Analysis\nAcademic Writing\nCV Development\nBest For\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT\nExcellent for step-by-step explanations and detailed code\nWorks well across all fields; adapts to different styles\nStrong at creating variations for different contexts\nOverall versatility and detailed help\n\n\nClaude\nGreat at complex statistical thinking and explaining choices\nKeeps your authentic voice while improving clarity\nThoughtful about showing real achievements honestly\nComplex reasoning and keeping scholarly voice\n\n\nGemini\nGood connection with Google Colab; strong visualization tips\nEffective for quick edits; can use uploaded papers as examples\nUseful for formatting and comparing to job descriptions\nGoogle tools integration and quick work\n\n\nDeepSeek\nStrong math reasoning at lower cost; clear technical answers\nEfficient for straightforward editing in STEM fields\nCost-effective for multiple drafts\nBudget-friendly and technical content\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Note on Pricing: The most powerful versions of all these AI tools require paid subscriptions, typically around €20 per month. This gives you access to the latest models with better reasoning capabilities and fewer usage limits. However, if you prefer not to pay subscription fees, both ChatGPT and Gemini offer free versions that are adequate for basic tasks. While these free versions have limitations—such as access to older models, slower response times, and usage caps—they can still handle routine academic tasks reasonably well. For occasional users or those just exploring AI tools, the free versions are a good starting point.\nIf you have decided to subscribe one AI tool, here are my tool picks:\nFor Data Analysis: I recommend Claude as the top choice for researchers who need careful statistical thinking and thorough consideration of methods. ChatGPT is an excellent second choice for its strong code generation.\nFor Academic Writing: Claude stands out for keeping your authentic scholarly voice while making writing clearer—critical for researchers building their academic identity. For non-native English speakers, ChatGPT is also excellent for handling diverse writing styles.\nFor CV Development: ChatGPT is the leader for creating multiple tailored versions for different applications. Claude works well as a backup for presenting achievements honestly.\nBudget Option: If cost matters most, DeepSeek offers great value for technical work.\n\n\n\n\nWhile these tools are useful today, I must emphasize key challenges:\nAlways Check AI Work: AI-generated content needs expert review. I’ve caught many believable-sounding errors that only domain knowledge could spot. AI should help, not replace, your judgment.\nPrivacy Matters: Never upload sensitive research data or unpublished findings without thinking carefully. Protect your intellectual property.\nRules Are Changing: Schools and journals are still creating policies on AI use.
