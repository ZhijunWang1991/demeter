## About Nieuwmount

Nieuwmount is an independent hub for **AI and research** on tools, workflows, and templates that are actually useful in day-to-day scientific work.

## What you’ll find here

* **AI Tools:** curated tools with research-focused notes and practical use cases
* **AI News & Analysis:** what changed, why it matters, and how it affects research workflows
* **R code for Research:** reproducible, code-first tutorials for data analysis and visualization
* **Python for Research:** modeling, plotting, and publication-ready analysis pipelines
* **Academic Prompts:** prompt templates for writing, revision, peer review, and study planning
* **AI Image Prompts:** a tagged gallery of prompts for figures and research visuals (prompt + negative prompt + platform)

## Who runs it

I’m **Michael**, a researcher and AI practitioner working across **data visualization**, **research project management**, and **modeling/analysis**. I also spend a lot of time on **prompt optimization** and **AI-assisted figure generation**, testing what works in real research settings. Nieuwmount is where I publish the workflows, code, and prompt libraries I wish I had clean, reusable, and easy to apply.
